# Issue report Management

This repository contains our source code and data on the use of machine learning methods to automatically detect the objective and priority-level of issue reports in software repositories.

Objective Detection: 
This directory contains our scripts on state-of-the-art ML algorithms to automatically identify the goal behind opeining an issue and categorziing them into three groups of bug reports, enhancement requests, and finally support

Priority Prediction: 
This directory contains our scripts on ML models for prediciting the priority of an issue report for task assigneent or maintenance purposes.

Notebook:
This directory contatins notebooks for five diffrenet software project. In each of them with tf-idf and fasttext methods we find related method to each issue on our preprocessed datasets which we crawled it and do preprocessing pipeline on it
